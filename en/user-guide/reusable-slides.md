A set of slides is available on this web site.
You can reuse them for you presentations (training, courses, conferences...).
You can also copy and adapt them for your own context.

**Short presentation** (use cases)

* [Slides In English](/slides/general/roboconf-use-cases.html)
* [Slides in French](/slides/general/cas-d-usage-de-roboconf.html)

**Long presentation** (general and technical)

* [Slides In English](/slides/general/roboconf-presentation.html)
* [Slides in French](/slides/general/presentation-roboconf.html)

They are based on [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js).
You can copy the HTML page and remove or add sections.

Several style sheets (CSS) are available.
But you can create and use your own one if you want.

* [Roboconf style](/slides/general/css/roboconf.css)
* [Linagora style](/slides/general/css/linagora.css)

To switch the style, update the CSS mark-up in the HTML presentation.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/roboconf.css" id="theme">
```

Diagrams were designed with [draw.io](https://www.draw.io).
Slides and diagram sources are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/roboconf/roboconf.github.io/).

Eventually, you can generate PDF from this (or your derived) presentation.
See the instructions on [reveal's readme](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#pdf-export).
